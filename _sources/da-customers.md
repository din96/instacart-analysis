### TO DO 
The marketing and business strategy units at Instacart want to create more-relevant marketing strategies for different products and are, thus, curious about customer profiling in their database. Create a profiling variable based on age, income, certain goods in the “department_id” column, and number of dependents. You might also use the “orders_day_of_the_week” and “order_hour_of_day” columns if you can think of a way they would impact customer profiles. (Hint: As an example, try thinking of what characteristics would lead you to the profile “Single adult” or “Young parent.”)

- [ ] Create an appropriate visualization to show the distribution of profiles.
- [ ] Aggregate the max, mean, and min variables on a customer-profile level for usage frequency and expenditure.
- [ ] Compare your customer profiles with regions and departments. Can you identify a link between them? Customers may demonstrate different behaviors across regions, which could make this information important.
