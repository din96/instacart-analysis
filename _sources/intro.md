## Project Objective

```{admonition} Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The project obejctive is **to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis** of some of their data **to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation** based on the provided criteria.
```

## Stakeholders

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

> **Vice President of Marketing** <br/> “We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”

> **Senior Vice President of Sales** <br/>"We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales.”

> **Instacart Customer** <br/> “I want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products I order regularly.”
