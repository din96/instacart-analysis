- customer segmenation by region

- [ ] FLAG region
- The Instacart officers are interested in comparing customer behavior in different geographic areas. Create a regional segmentation of the data. You’ll need to create a “Region” column based on the “State” column from your - customers data set.
Use the region information in this Wikipedia article to create your column (you only need to create regions, not divisions).


## Products 

### Bestsellers 
- The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?




SALES
- [ ] FLAG low-activity customer
The Instacart CFO isn’t interested in customers who don’t generate much revenue for the app. Create an exclusion flag for low-activity customers (customers with less than 5 orders) and exclude them from the data. Make sure you export this sample.

- [ ] DATA INSIGH Determine whether there’s a difference in spending habits between the different U.S. regions. (Hint: You can do this by crossing the variable you just created with the spending flag.)
